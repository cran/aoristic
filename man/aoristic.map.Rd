\title{Plot aoristic probabilities for one hour}
\usage{
aoristic.map(data1, AorHour = "1")
}
\arguments{
\item{data1}{a data frame output from the aoristic.df function}

\item{AorHour}{user-selected number for an hour in the week (range 1-168)}
}
\value{
A ggplot object
}
\description{
Creates a plot showing aoristic probability values for one hour of the week. The X, Y coordinate pair (or latitude
and longitude) are used to create a plot that shows each event that could have occured in the user-
selected hour. Each event is color coded to represent the aoristic weight, range >0 to 1. Events
with weight 1 definitely occurred during that hour, while events with values at the lower end of the
range could have occured at one of many hours. For guidance on which day/hour is represented by a
number, use aoristic.ref()
