\title{Create aoristic distribution chart}
\usage{
aoristic.graph(data1, marks = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data1}{a data frame output from the aoristic2.df function}

\item{marks}{marks=FALSE. TRUE shows tick marks for week distribution. Default is FALSE.}
}
\description{
Takes the output from the aoristic.summary() function and converts that data frame
into a series of eight charts for each day of the week (and a total chart) based on the
aggregate aoristic distribution of the events. 
Option (marks = TRUE) adds small tick marks showing the (y-axis adjusted) overall weekly 
distribution for comparison to the daily value.
