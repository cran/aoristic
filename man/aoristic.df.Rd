\title{Calculate aoristic weights}
\usage{
aoristic.df(data1, Xcoord, Ycoord, DateTimeFrom, DateTimeTo)
}
\arguments{
\item{data1}{data frame with a minimum of 4 columns with X, Y coords, Start and End date/time}

\item{Xcoord}{a vector of the event X coordinate or latitude (numeric object)}

\item{Ycoord}{a vector of the event Y coordinate or longitude (numeric object)}

\item{DateTimeFrom}{a vector of the column name for FromDateTime (POSIXct date-time object)}

\item{DateTimeTo}{a vector of the column name for ToDateTime (POSIXct date-time object)}
}
\value{
A data frame with aoristic values for each hour of the week for each observation
}
\description{
Calculates aoristic proportional weights across 168 units representing each hour of the week (24 hours x 7 days). 
It is designed for situations when an event time is not know but could be spread across numerous
hours or days, and is represented by a Start (or From) date and time, and an End (or To) date and time.
The output retains the source data, and can be reimported into a GIS for spatial analysis. The output 
from this function is used in other aoristic library functions.
}
\details{
NOTE: If an observation is missing the End/To datetime, the entire aoristic weight (1.0) will be assigned to the
hour block containing the Start/From datetime. Events with start datetime events after the end datetime will also 
be assigned to the hour block containing the Start/From datetime. Events with time spans lasting more than one 
week (>168 hours) will default to a time span of 168 hours and a value of ~ 0.0059 (1/168) assigned to each day/hour.
